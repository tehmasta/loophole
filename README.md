# Simplistic Port Scanner in Python3

💻 A simple port scanner written in Python3, created as my first programming project;

while I'm ~~learning the language.~~ TRYING to learn the language! 🔍

## Usage

To use this port scanner, simply run the `loophole.py` file with the following command:

```
python3 loophole.py
```

You can also specify the IP address and range of ports you want to scan as command line arguments, like so:

```
python3 loophole.py <ip_address>
```

The script will then scan the ip given on a specified range of ports and display which ones are open.
